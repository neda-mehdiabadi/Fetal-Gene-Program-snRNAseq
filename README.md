## Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of **single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq)** data to define the **fetal gene program** in **early-onset dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)** at **single-cell resolution**. It supports the findings of the manuscript:

## Dataset Summary
| Group         | Age Range       | Samples (n) | Nuclei Count |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Fetal         | 19â€“20 weeks      | 3           | 27,136        |
| Non-Diseased  | 4â€“14 years       | 3           | 16,445        |
| Early-Onset DCM | 5â€“10 years     | 4           | 31,593        |

- All samples are derived from the **left ventricle**.
- This is a large single nuclei RNA-seq dataset from the Heart Regeneration group at Murdoch Children's Research Institute. 
 
## Key Analyses
-  **Cell Type Identification**  
  Annotate and cluster cell types within each group using unsupervised methods.
-  **Cell Composition Analysis**  
  Compare shifts in cell-type abundance across healthy, fetal, and DCM states.
-  **Pathway and Transcriptional Analysis**  
  Discover regulatory changes and transcription factor activity in DCM.
-  **Fetal Gene Program Recovery in DCM**  
  Identify gene expression signatures indicative of fetal-like reprogramming in disease.

## Explore the Data
We have built an **interactive web portal** that permits interrogation of our data set and, hence, increases the data setâ€™s accessibility and utility. To check our website, please visit [www.HeartExplorer.org](http://www.HeartExplorer.org/).
